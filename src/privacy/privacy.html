        California Online Privacy Protection Act
      </h3>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
        policy. The law's reach
        stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
        operates websites
        collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its
        website stating exactly
        the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -

      </p>
      <h3>
        According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users can visit our site anonymously.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first
          significant page after entering
          our website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On our Privacy Policy Page
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Users are able to change their personal information:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            By logging in to their account
          </li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>
        How does our site handle do not track signals?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
        browser mechanism is in
        place. We don't honor them because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we don't use third party tracking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.
      </p>
      <h3>
        COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
      </h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy
        Protection Act (COPPA) puts
        parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
        which spells out what
        operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not specifically market to children under 13.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Fair Information Practices
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they
        include have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
        Practice Principles and how
        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a
          data breach occur:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will notify the users via in site notification
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Within 7 business days
          </li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
        enforceable rights against
        data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
        enforceable rights against
        data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
        non-compliance by data
        processors.
      </p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages,
        gives recipients the
        right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
      </p>
      <p>
