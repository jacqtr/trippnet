          "detail": "<p>May 1 is National College Decision Day. If you get accepted to multiple colleges, including Drexel, you'll need to decide in s wouldlwhich school you will enroll.&nbsp;Usually you must pay an enrollment or housing deposit to secure your space.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider -- Which school is your best fit academically and socially? Which school grants you the most affordable financial aid package?&nbsp;</p><p>Remember: It is best to send a deposit to only ONE school. It's generally considered unethical to send in deposits to multiple schools...not to mention awfully costly to you! Carefully consider your options and make the best choice for you. Ask for help from a knowledgable adult if you're not sure.</p>"
